Three-Tier Web Application

## Overview
Built a fully serverless three-tier web application using AWS services, demonstrating end-to-end cloud architecture design, deployment, and security best practices.

## Architecture Layers
- **Presentation Tier (Frontend):** Static website hosted on Amazon S3
- **Application Tier (API):** REST API created with AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda
- **Data Tier (Database):** Serverless database using Amazon DynamoDB

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon S3
- Amazon API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB
- AWS IAM
- AWS CloudWatch (for monitoring and logging)

## Key Features
- Fully serverless deployment with no traditional servers
- RESTful API architecture with Lambda integration
- Schema-less DynamoDB design with partition keys
- Secure IAM policies for Lambda and API Gateway access control
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Production deployment with live API endpoints

## Skills Demonstrated
- AWS Serverless Architecture
- Three-Tier Web Application Design
- API Gateway + Lambda Integration
- DynamoDB Data Modeling
- IAM Security Best Practices
- API Documentation
- Monitoring with CloudWatch

## Time to Complete
Approximately 4-5 hours

## Challenges Overcome
- Coordinating API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB integration
- Debugging IAM permission issues for least-privilege access
- Writing OpenAPI documentation for deployed API endpoints
